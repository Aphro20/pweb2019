        <img src="t-1.jpg" alt="Tjong A Fie" style="width:50%" style="padding: 10px">
        <p style="padding: 10px">Anyone who has been to Cheong Fatt Tze Mansion in Penang in Malaysia may find Tjong A Fie Mansion familiar, and Tjong A Fie was actually a relative of Cheong Fatt Tze hence the similarities between the two buildings.
                The mansion is one of the top attractions in Medan and is a great place to see how people would have lived in this city in the 1900s.
                You can take a guided tour around the mansion which will take around an hour and hear all about the history here with one of the attentive guides.
                As you walk around make sure to check out all the ornate decorations and the pretty garden for which the mansion is famous.</p>

        <h2 style="padding: 10px">2. Masjid Raya</h2>
        <img src="t-2.jpg" alt="Tjong A Fie" style="width:50%" style="padding: 10px">
        <p style="padding: 10px">Mesjid Raya Al Mashun, or simply Mesjid Raya as it is often referred to, is Medanâ€™s main mosque and is known for being one of its prettiest.
            The mosque was built using imported building materials such as Italian marble and you can take a tour and check out all the exquisite details here.
            Some things to look out for include the pretty stained glass touches as well as the emerald green tiles, and the mosque is topped with dark elegant domes.
            Non-Muslims are welcome to tour the mosque outside of prayer hours, but make sure to dress respectfully.</p>
        <h2 style="padding: 10px">3. Istana Maimun</h2>
        <img src="t-3.jpg" alt="Istana Maimun" style="width:50%" style="padding: 10px">
        <p style="padding: 10px">Istana Maimun is the name of the royal palace in Medan which belonged to the Sultanate of Deli.
                Nowadays parts of the palace are open to the public and have been turned into a museum.
                These include the throne room and there are a few displays that explain the history of the royal family and some collections of ancient clothing and other objects of interest.
                One of the big draws here is that for a small fee you can dress up in period garb and take pictures in the throne room, and you can also walk around the lush grounds that encircle the palace.</p>
